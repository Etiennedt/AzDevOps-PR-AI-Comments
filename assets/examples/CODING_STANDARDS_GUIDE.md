# Strong Terraform Coding Standards

- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Use consistent naming (e.g., snake_case or kebab-case) for resources, variables, modules, and outputs.
- **Module Organization:** Structure code into reusable modules with clear input and output definitions.
- **Version Pinning:** Specify explicit versions for Terraform providers and modules to ensure predictable deployments.
- **File Structure:** Separate configuration into logical files (e.g., `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `providers.tf`) for better maintainability.
- **Documentation:** Include concise inline comments and maintain README files for modules to clarify purpose and usage.
- **State Management:** Use remote state storage with state locking to securely manage and share state files.
- **Formatting and Linting:** Enforce a uniform style with `terraform fmt` and leverage linters (e.g., `tflint`) to catch issues early.
- **Variables and Locals:** Utilize variables and locals to eliminate duplication and enhance clarity.
- **Tagging Strategy:** Implement a standardized tagging strategy to ensure all resources are properly identified.
- **Environment Isolation:** Use workspaces or separate state files to clearly distinguish between development, staging, and production environments.
- **Secrets Management:** Avoid hard-coded sensitive values; integrate secret management tools or environment variables where appropriate.
- **Output Clarity:** Define clear outputs for modules to expose essential resource attributes for downstream use.
- **Provider Configuration:** Configure provider blocks consistently and securely across all modules.
- **Testing and Validation:** Incorporate automated testing and validation frameworks to ensure infrastructure changes meet standards.
- **Security Best Practices:** Apply secure defaults and least privilege principles in all resource definitions.

# Strong Python Coding Standards

- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Use snake_case for variables, functions, and methods, and PascalCase for classes.
- **PEP 8 Compliance:** Follow the PEP 8 style guide for formatting, indentation, line length, and overall code style.
- **Clear and Descriptive Naming:** Choose names that clearly describe the purpose and behavior of functions, variables, and classes.
- **Type Annotations:** Utilize type hints for function signatures and variable declarations to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Docstrings:** Include concise docstrings for modules, classes, and functions to explain functionality and intent.
- **Modular Architecture:** Organize code into modules and packages with a clear separation of responsibilities.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust exception handling to manage errors gracefully and maintain code stability.
- **Immutable Defaults:** Use immutable objects as default values for function parameters to prevent unintended side effects.
- **Efficient Data Structures:** Leverage Python's built-in data structures effectively to optimize performance and memory usage.
- **Code Readability:** Write self-documenting code with clear comments and a logical structure that enhances understandability.
- **Testing Practices:** Integrate unit tests and continuous testing to ensure code reliability and simplify maintenance.
- **Dependency Management:** Manage third-party libraries using virtual environments and dependency files (e.g., requirements.txt).
- **Logging:** Implement structured logging for debugging and monitoring, ensuring logs are clear and informative.
- **Security Practices:** Adhere to secure coding guidelines to protect against vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.
- **Continuous Integration:** Use automated testing and code quality checks in a CI pipeline to maintain high standards.
- **Version Control Discipline:** Maintain clean commit histories and follow branching strategies to streamline collaboration.
- **Performance Optimization:** Write efficient code by considering algorithmic complexity and resource management.

# Strong PowerShell Coding Standards

- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Use PascalCase for functions and cmdlets, and camelCase for parameters and variables.
- **Verb-Noun Format:** Adopt the Verb-Noun convention for all functions and cmdlets to ensure clarity.
- **Modular Structure:** Organize code into modules and scripts with clearly defined responsibilities.
- **Comment-Based Help:** Provide comprehensive comment-based help in every script and function for clarity and ease of use.
- **Error Handling:** Utilize Try/Catch/Finally blocks to manage errors gracefully and maintain script robustness.
- **Pipeline Efficiency:** Design functions to integrate smoothly with the pipeline and support common parameters.
- **Consistent Code Formatting:** Maintain uniform indentation, spacing, and line breaks for improved readability.
- **Security Practices:** Implement secure coding measures by validating inputs and managing credentials securely.
- **Script Metadata:** Include metadata such as version, author, and dependencies in scripts and modules.
- **Testing and Validation:** Incorporate testing frameworks and validation checks to ensure reliable performance.
- **Logging and Auditing:** Integrate structured logging to facilitate debugging and monitor script execution.
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear inline comments and external documentation to explain functionality and design intent.
- **Continuous Integration:** Utilize automated testing and code quality tools in your CI/CD pipeline.
- **Performance Considerations:** Optimize scripts by minimizing unnecessary processing and leveraging efficient cmdlets.
- **Compatibility:** Ensure scripts maintain compatibility across different PowerShell versions as needed.
- **Reusable Components:** Develop functions and modules with reusability in mind to support scalability and easier maintenance.

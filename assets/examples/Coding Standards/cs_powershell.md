# Strong PowerShell Coding Standards

- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Use PascalCase for functions and cmdlets, and camelCase for parameters and variables.
- **Verb-Noun Format:** Adopt the Verb-Noun convention for all functions and cmdlets to ensure clarity.
- **Modular Structure:** Organize code into modules and scripts with clearly defined responsibilities.
- **Comment-Based Help:** Provide comprehensive comment-based help in every script and function for clarity and ease of use.
- **Error Handling:** Utilize Try/Catch/Finally blocks to manage errors gracefully and maintain script robustness.
- **Pipeline Efficiency:** Design functions to integrate smoothly with the pipeline and support common parameters.
- **Consistent Code Formatting:** Maintain uniform indentation, spacing, and line breaks for improved readability.
- **Security Practices:** Implement secure coding measures by validating inputs and managing credentials securely.
- **Script Metadata:** Include metadata such as version, author, and dependencies in scripts and modules.
- **Testing and Validation:** Incorporate testing frameworks and validation checks to ensure reliable performance.
- **Logging and Auditing:** Integrate structured logging to facilitate debugging and monitor script execution.
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear inline comments and external documentation to explain functionality and design intent.
- **Continuous Integration:** Utilize automated testing and code quality tools in your CI/CD pipeline.
- **Performance Considerations:** Optimize scripts by minimizing unnecessary processing and leveraging efficient cmdlets.
- **Compatibility:** Ensure scripts maintain compatibility across different PowerShell versions as needed.
- **Reusable Components:** Develop functions and modules with reusability in mind to support scalability and easier maintenance.

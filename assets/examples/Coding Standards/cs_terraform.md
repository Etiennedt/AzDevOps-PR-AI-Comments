# Strong Terraform Coding Standards

- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Use consistent naming (e.g., snake_case or kebab-case) for resources, variables, modules, and outputs.
- **Module Organization:** Structure code into reusable modules with clear input and output definitions.
- **Version Pinning:** Specify explicit versions for Terraform providers and modules to ensure predictable deployments.
- **File Structure:** Separate configuration into logical files (e.g., `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `providers.tf`) for better maintainability.
- **Documentation:** Include concise inline comments and maintain README files for modules to clarify purpose and usage.
- **State Management:** Use remote state storage with state locking to securely manage and share state files.
- **Formatting and Linting:** Enforce a uniform style with `terraform fmt` and leverage linters (e.g., `tflint`) to catch issues early.
- **Variables and Locals:** Utilize variables and locals to eliminate duplication and enhance clarity.
- **Tagging Strategy:** Implement a standardized tagging strategy to ensure all resources are properly identified.
- **Environment Isolation:** Use workspaces or separate state files to clearly distinguish between development, staging, and production environments.
- **Secrets Management:** Avoid hard-coded sensitive values; integrate secret management tools or environment variables where appropriate.
- **Output Clarity:** Define clear outputs for modules to expose essential resource attributes for downstream use.
- **Provider Configuration:** Configure provider blocks consistently and securely across all modules.
- **Testing and Validation:** Incorporate automated testing and validation frameworks to ensure infrastructure changes meet standards.
- **Security Best Practices:** Apply secure defaults and least privilege principles in all resource definitions.
